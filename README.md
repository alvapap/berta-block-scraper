# berta-block-scraper
The initial idea was born out of nececity to see when the boulder gym has free spots and have 
a progression for the past weeks of how well-attended the gym is.

The service is scraping a url from Berta Block and applying a regular expression to retrieve 
the number of free spots. The metrics can be then exposed to prometheus.
